Cloud Security Analyzer
=======================

Overview
--------

The Cloud Security Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to scan and analyze AWS cloud resources to identify potential network security risks. It uses boto3 to interact with AWS APIs and Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure. The tool generates detailed security findings, outputting them as CSV reports for easy review and remediation.

This project helps cloud engineers and security teams improve their cloud security posture by automating the detection of risky configurations such as open ports, overly permissive security groups, and misconfigured network resources.
