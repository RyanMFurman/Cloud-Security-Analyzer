Cloud Security Analyzer
=======================

Overview
--------

The Cloud Security Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to scan and analyze AWS cloud resources to identify potential network security risks. It uses boto3 to interact with AWS APIs and Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure. The tool generates detailed security findings, outputting them as CSV reports for easy review and remediation.

This project helps cloud engineers and security teams improve their cloud security posture by automating the detection of risky configurations such as open ports, overly permissive security groups, and misconfigured network resources.

Sample CSV content example:

Resource ID,Risk Level,Description,Recommendation,PCI Violation
sg-0719ffcacc71d2876,HIGH,Open access on port 22 (tcp) to internet,Restrict to specific IP ranges,YES
sg-05d1fee9c3faf8004,LOW,Security group not attached to any instances,Delete if no longer needed,NO
vpc-071b599614ddd6c61,MEDIUM,VPC CIDR block is large: 10.0.0.0/16,Consider narrowing CIDR range if possible,NO
subnet-0ecd1cdb294c60255,HIGH,Subnet is public (MapPublicIpOnLaunch=True),Restrict public IP mapping unless necessary,YES
rtb-0a4d8f53ec95cf6ba,MEDIUM,Route table has default route to NAT Gateway (private subnet with outbound internet),Ensure NAT routing is secured and monitored,NO
rtb-053a0c11993dc5123,HIGH,Route table has default route to Internet Gateway (public subnet),Limit default route to trusted resources,YES
nat-0bddfceb8d837980b,MEDIUM,NAT Gateway in subnet subnet-0e5666eafb6e26f77 is in state 'deleted',Verify NAT Gateway deployment state,NO
acl-0f297c95cfca44250,HIGH,Network ACL allows all traffic (egress),Restrict overly permissive ACL rules,YES
acl-0f297c95cfca44250,HIGH,Network ACL allows all traffic (ingress),Restrict overly permissive ACL rules,YES

Future Work
-----------

- Extend scanning support to Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Add more advanced findings and automated remediation suggestions.
- Integrate alerting and dashboard reporting capabilities.
